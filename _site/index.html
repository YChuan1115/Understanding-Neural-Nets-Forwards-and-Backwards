  <h4> March 21st, 2017</h4>

  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My goal in writing this is to help foster a better intuition into how neural nets operate. Neural nets have proved revolutionary in the field of artificial intelligence. While neural nets can quickly assume truly daunting levels of complexity, their underlying mechanics are relatively straightforward. A neural network is an ensemble of nodes and the connections between them (also referred to here as 'edges'). These nodes are assembled into layers, with an input layer recieving an input corresponding to an observation (e.g. "Is the pixel red? [yes/no]") and the final layer producing an output (e.g. "Probability that the image is that of an apple: 88%"). These networks may be dozens of layers deep or more, hence the term 'deep-learning.' The stage where information permeates the network, is weighted and reweighted, and is then ultimately used to generate an output is referred to as a 'forward pass.' Of course, even the most well-designed neural net won't get things right on the first try. The net needs exposure to additional information in order to learn. This learning mechanism takes the form of updates to the connections between the nodes. If a connection is conveying information that contributes greatly to the final prediction, then an incorrect categorization will result in this connection being penalized heavily - essentially preventing the connection from conveying information from future observations. The process by which the error signal is generated and then used to update the network's connections is reffered to as 'back propagation,' in that the error signal is propagated backwards through the network from finish to start. </p> 

  <h4> One Forward Pass Across a 'Simple' Neural Network </h4>

  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this post I will walk step-by-step through a single epoch of a simple, three-node neural network. An epoch is defined as one iteration of the model that utilizes the entirety of the avialable training data. For our purposes, the epoch will consist of a single observation. Our hypothetical network has two input variables 'X1' and 'X2', one output variable 'Y', and a training data set that is comprised of a single observation [8, -4]. The interior of the network is comprised of two layers - one hidden layer of two nodes followed by a single node output layer. We can unpack this network further by visualizing the weights as grey squares. Lastly, the activation function that preceeds the output 'Y' is a sigmoid function. </p>

  </p>

  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When initializing a neural net, the weights are typically initialized to small random values chosen from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of about 0.01 ([Hinton](http://www.csri.utoronto.ca/~hinton/absps/guideTR.pdf), 2010, p.9). We start the forward pass by multiplying our initial inputs ('X1' and 'X2') times their respective weights, and then summing the results. Next, we repeat the process for the nodes in the hidden layer - multiplying the output of H1 times its weight, multiplying the output of H2 times its weight, and summing the two products to create the value associated with the output node 'O1'. Our final step is the activation function - in this case, a sigmoid function.  </p>

  <h4> What is a Gradient? </h4>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of backwards propagation is to enable us to train the model - typically with some version of gradient descent. To understand how gradient descent is accomplished, it is helpful to know what a gradient is. Below is a visualization of what an error gradient would look like with two variables. In deriving the error gradient, our variables are referred to as 'edges' - the connections between nodes. </p>

  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A neural net can be thought of as one, very large differentiable equation with many variables. To better understand any complex system with many inputs, it is often useful to specify a relationship between the outcome variable and a specific variable of interest. Mathmatically, we do this by taking the partial derivative of the equation with respect to the variable of interest. When taking the partial derivative, any component of the expression that is not somehow associated with the variable of interest is effectively set to zero. Note in the figure below how different elements drop out of relevance based on what variable we are taking the partial derivative with respect to. </p>
  <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those wanting additional detail, I highly recommend [this](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/gradient-and-directional-derivatives/v/gradient) series of video lectures from Kahn Academy. </p>
